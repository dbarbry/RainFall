	<b><i>Cybersecurity project to learn more about buffer overflow.</i></b><br>
</p>

Welcome to our Rainfall. For every exercice we wrote a very detailed explanations of how we found the solutions as well as some deep explanations on how memory works, or everything that can be usefull to understand buffer overflows used in Rainfall. The explanations are meant to be as clear as possible, you can find them in every README.md of every level of this project. You also can have more explanations if necessary in Resources/explanations.md of every level.

This project has been done with @Rgeral a great friend of mine, and we did this project in approximatively 2 months. This project was definitely way harder that SnowCrash, also way more interesting, that's why it contains way more explanations.

If you have any questions you can join me at dhayabarbry@proton.me.

# Organisation

Each exercice will be organized like so:
```
levelX/
├─ Resources/
│  ├─ explanation.md
│  └─ resources1.ext
├─ README.md
├─ flag
├─ source.c
└─ walkthrough.md
```
The explanations are both in README.md and explanations.md. In source.c an equivalent of the level's binary translation is made (and working). walkthrough.md simply described the steps to follow to exploit the files without further explanations.
